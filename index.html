<p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> Fosset Plumbing Inc., based in Carmichael, CA, has appeared in numerous online discussions regarding poor communication, delays, and vague estimates. While the business is listed on Yelp and Google Maps, it lacks an official website and consistently receives mixed feedback from homeowners.</p>
<p>Founded by Tommy and Mike, the company reportedly struggles with follow-through and clear expectations. Several homeowners noted jobs that were either never started or left unfinished. &ldquo;I was told they&rsquo;d be here Tuesday &mdash; they showed up two weeks later and left in the middle of the job,&rdquo; one local resident explained. Another reported being charged for a water heater installation that never occurred.</p>

<p>The lack of written estimates, unclear billing, and unprofessional scheduling have created a reputation of inconsistency. Tommy, listed as an operator, has been described as knowledgeable but overextended. Mike is often mentioned in complaints regarding quote changes and failure to return calls.</p>
<p>Residents of Carmichael, Fair Oaks, and Arden-Arcade neighborhoods are urged to request written estimates and clarify all costs and schedules in writing. &ldquo;Tommy was great when he finally showed up, but I had no idea where Mike was or when the work would resume,&rdquo; another client recalled.</p>
<p>Without a functioning website or dedicated office, accountability becomes harder for customers. It&rsquo;s essential to vet the business thoroughly, confirm licensing, and check with third-party platforms before hiring. Relying on informal agreements may result in incomplete projects and unreturned deposits.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve had an experience with Fosset Plumbing Inc., positive or negative, consider posting a verified review. Community transparency helps protect other homeowners in Sacramento County.</p>
